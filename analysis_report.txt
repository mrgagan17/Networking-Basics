CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
TASK 3: Networking Basics for Cyber Security

Tool Used: Wireshark

1. Introduction
This task focuses on understanding basic networking concepts and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.

2. Packet Capture
Live network traffic was captured using Wireshark by selecting the active Wi-Fi interface.

3. Protocol Analysis
- TCP: Reliable communication protocol
- UDP: Fast but unreliable protocol
- DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- HTTP: Plain-text communication
- HTTPS: Encrypted communication

4. TCP Three-Way Handshake
Observed SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets which establish a TCP connection.

5. Plain-text vs Encrypted Traffic
HTTP traffic data was readable, whereas HTTPS traffic was encrypted and unreadable.

6. DNS Analysis
DNS queries revealed the domain names accessed during browsing.

7. Conclusion
This task improved understanding of how network communication works and highlighted the importance of encrypted traffic for security.
