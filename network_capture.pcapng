Note on Packet Capture File:

Due to system restrictions and privacy concerns, the packet capture file 
(.pcapng) could not be attached. However, the task was performed using 
Wireshark, and observations were recorded based on live traffic analysis 
including TCP handshake, DNS queries, and HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

The process and understanding are clearly documented in this report.
